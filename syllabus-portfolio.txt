* What\rsquo{}s It All About?
  This course is about *mathematics for computer science.*

  It introduces the mathematical topics needed to provide a solid theoretical
  foundation for your career and continued learning in computer science.

  The following topics will be covered:

  + Sets and Logic
  + Functions and Relations
  + Combinatorics and Probability
  + Number Theory and Practice
  + Trees and Graphs
  + Languages and Grammars

* Outcomes
  + Master the basic terminology and operations of sets and logic, functions and
    relations, combinatorics and probability, number theory and practice, trees
    and graphs, and languages and grammars.
  + Demonstrate logical reasoning as you solve interesting problems.
  + Interpret the meaning of mathematical statements in the context of
    applications in computer science.
  + Think like a mathematician by making good connections.
  + Learn basic functional programming through using, reading, and writing elisp
    code. (See [[file:elisp-mini-primer.txt][elisp-mini-primer.txt]].)

* Prerequisites
  + You must have successfully completed CS 165, Object-Oriented Software Development.
  + You must also have developed an awareness of what logical thinking entails.

* Requirements
** Required Text
  + [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html][Metaphors Be With You]]

** Required Software
  To install these tools, see the instructions [[https://rickneff.github.io][here]] (and go to the /Tools/
  section).
  + git
  + Emacs/Spacemacs

** Required Accounts
   You are required to have an account using your real name and school email
   address with (at least) these three platforms:
   + https://github.com (free)
   + https://kritik.io (requires paying a $15 fee)
   + https://quizlet.com (free)

** Required Behaviors
  You are required to:
  + attend class, as assessments will happen in class each day that are not
    reproducible outside of class;
  + read assigned portions of the course materials /before/ class each Tuesday;
  + complete all team and personal assessments to deepen your understanding of
    selected topics; and
  + bring a laptop or other Internet-connectable (and tools-ready) device to
    each class meeting.
  + maintain a portfolio of your completed work (see below).

* Course Periodicity
  This course has a weekly period, i.e., you can count on knowing ahead of time
  what you will be doing each day of each week. Each class meeting consists of two
  types of activity:

** Tuesdays
  - Presentation :: --- A time where I will add depth information to the preparation
                    material you finished reading *before class*.
  - Class Directed Learning :: --- You will participate in a class-wide activity that
       reinforces what you\rsquo{}ve read and what I\rsquo{}ve shown you.

** Thursdays
  - Readiness Assessment :: --- A short in-class quiz on the reading and topics
       for the week.
  - Answer Questions :: --- I will answer questions that have surfaced through
       various means, including the quiz you will have just taken.

* Questions
  + Some of the questions answered on Thursdays are verbatim or generalized from
    those you create via the [[https://rickneff.github.io/kritik-introduction.html][Kritik platform]].
  + Creating and evaluating questions help you develop higher order thinking
    skills.
  + You will have plenty of questions. Engage with them! Choose knowledge over
    ignorance.
* Work
** Exercises
   Exercises are smaller experiences that are designed to float uncertainties and
   questions you have to the surface of your mind. They are designed to be smaller
   so you can find out what you don\rsquo{}t know and then take the steps necessary to
   know.

** Problems
   Problems are weightier experiences that invite you to explore topics in discrete
   mathematics, as well as increase your logical thinking and problem solving
   prowess. Many of these involve writing mathematically (see [[file:org-mode-primer.txt][org-mode-primer.txt]]).

   [[https://rickneff.github.io/exercises-versus-problems.html][Here is a description of the difference]] between Exercises and Problems.
** Puzzles
   Puzzles are like problems, only with another added measure of difficulty that
   will require even more ingenuity, deep thought and persistent effort to
   solve. (Think \ldquo{}Escape Room\rdquo --- where you must solve a series of puzzles in
   order to escape from a room.) But the hints are more obscure, and in fact the
   statement of the problem may be obscure, indirect or encoded somehow. Solving
   these, or even attempting to do so, is one kind of \ldquo{}above and beyond\rdquo
   behavior (see below). Each has four subsections, as shown:
*** Rephrase
     A textual description showing you understand the \ldquo{}heart of the problem\rdquo.
*** Approach
     A textual description of how you approached solving the problem.
*** Solution
     The solution itself. (Most beneficial if it works, or the correct answer is
     reached.)
*** Proof
     A textual description of how you know the solution is correct. The more
     robust the argument, the better.

* Assessment
  About every four weeks you will meet with me in my office. The purpose of this
  meeting is for you to present your portfolio of work to me, make a
  grade-to-date claim, and provide evidence justifying that claim.

  Your portfolio *MUST* be a modified version of this file, and those included by
  it. All entries must follow the example format you will find at the end of
  this file. Also, your evidences must be complete and internally consistent.
  You are required to produce your portfolio using Spacemacs, and you *MUST* be
  able to successfully export it as an HTML file (see the link at the top of
  this file).

* Grades
  In each of our three personal meetings, you will present your portfolio and a
  letter-based grade-to-date claim. Afterwards I will give you my thoughts on
  the strength of your claim. The last claim that you make (*not an average* of
  the three), taking into account any feedback from me, will be your final grade
  for the course. All of your claims must must be evidence-based. That means you
  *MUST* bring the evidence with you, in your portfolio, that supports your
  claim.

** Letter-Based
   When making your claim, you are required to use the [[http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system][BYU-Idaho standard]]
   letter-based definition of grades, reproduced below. *Note with one exception
   that there are no plusses or minuses!*

   + \ldquo{}A\rdquo represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of
     subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use
     of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems.
     Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including
     initiative in serving other students.
   + \ldquo{}B\rdquo represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and
     incorporation of the material that would prepare a student to be successful
     in next level courses, graduate school, or employment. The student
     participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
   + \ldquo{}C\rdquo represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student
     demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses
     could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging.
     The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
   + \ldquo{}D\rdquo represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and
     apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary
     to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
   + \ldquo{}D-\rdquo represents failure in the course. [[https://rickneff.github.io/why-not-f.html][Why not F?]]

   Note that the above description of an \ldquo{}A\rdquo implies that you have gone *above
   and beyond*. To claim this grade you *must* have done and recorded evidence
   in your portfolio of doing *some* of the behaviors listed below, *each week*
   throughout each 4-week period.
   1. teaching and/or helping others in the class but not in your group
   2. teaching a Non-CS, Non-CE, Non-EE, Non-SE major about the material in
      this class to help them with a class they are taking
   3. applying what you\rsquo{}ve learned in this class in another class you are
      currently taking
   4. solving problems marked as optional
   5. solving puzzles
   6. doing other work not assigned, exploring other topics in mathematics,
      writing code implementing what you are learning that has not been
      assigned, etc.

   How many is *some*? It is doing at least two of the first three (1, 2, 3),
   *and* at least two of the last three (4, 5, 6).

   Regarding the first two about teaching others, quoting Truman Madsen (quoting
   the Prophet Joseph Smith): Now one of the strongest and wisest statements I
   have ever heard on egoism. The question was put to him, \ldquo{}Joseph, is the
   principle of self-aggrandizement wrong? Should we seek our own good?\rdquo Listen
   to his answer. \ldquo{}It is a correct principle and may be indulged upon only one
   rule or plan --- and that is to elevate, benefit, and bless others first. If
   you will elevate others, the very work itself will exalt you. Upon no other
   plan can a man justly and permanently aggrandize himself.\rdquo
* Moral/Legal
** Honor Code
   + [[http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/HJPtItSal?bc=true&bcCurrent=Academic%2520Honesty&bcGroup=University%2520Standards&bcItemType=policies][Academic Honesty]]
   + [[http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/SkaRPKHTl?bc=true&bcCurrent=Dress%2520and%2520Grooming%2520Standards&bcGroup=University%2520Standards&bcItemType=policies][Dress and Grooming]]

     Quoting from the latter:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Men are expected to be clean-shaven; beards are not acceptable.
#+END_QUOTE
  Regarding the celebrated [[https://byuiscroll.org/beard-card-used-abused/][beard card]]:
  1. Students who are requesting a first-time shaving exemption will be
     required to attend a seminar led by Student Honor Office administrators.
  2. All students who are seeking a shaving exemption, whether it’s a first
     time or a renewal exemption for the new semester, will have a one on one
     meeting with a Student Honor administrator to discuss the policy,
     expectations, and to sign a new commitment to abide by the standard as
     close as medically possible (i.e. no lumberjack beards).
  3. Students who are granted a shaving exemption will receive a printed card.
  4. Faculty members will be notified by the Student Honor Office through
     email when a student registered in their class receives a shaving
     exemption.
  5. All shaving exemptions are granted for no more than one semester and
     expire at the end of each semester.
  6. There will be a short grace period during the first week or two of the
     semester in order to give time for the Student Honor Office to process
     new requests.
  7. After that grace period, if you are not meeting the standard, and we have
     a conversation about it, and if it continues to be a problem, I will
     refer you to the Student Honor Office, which you must visit with before
     returning to class --- either clean-shaven or with a card.
