  This is the first of many exercises/problems/puzzles to come, always displayed
  in this type of yellow-background box.

  Propose a connection between discrete mathematics and the image below.
  (This is a \ldquo{}free association\rdquo exercise --- there is no \ldquo{}right\rdquo answer.)

#+begin_info
  The purpose of discrete mathematics is to create a finite scope of a large
  problem in order to come upon a solution. This relates to the above image in
  that the movement of massive sand dunes can be broken down to the
  movement of their individual grains. Grainular math is more discrete then dune
  math so to speak.

  The operation called /dehydration/ takes a word and deletes all letters in it
  from H to O. What is the original (rehydrated) text of this dehydrated
  sequence of words?

#+end_note
#+begin_info
  I will begin this problem by identifying all the letters that have been
  "dehydrated". All letters from H to O (H20) means H I J K L M N and O.
  Next I will rehydrate the words that probably only have one rehydrated
  solution; WARUS becomes WALRUS and CABBAGES remain CABBAGES. From this
  point I attempted to search the different word combinations with the
  given letters and the letters between h and o. This resulted in about
  10 different possibilities for nearly each word. After stewing over these
  for a while I searched walrus cabbage and lo-and-behold found a poem.
  THE TIME HAS COME, THE WALRUS SAID, TO TALK OF MANY THINGS OF SHOES AND
  SHIPS AND SEALING WAX OF CABBAGES AND KINGS AND WHY THE SEA IS BOILING HOT
  AND WHETHER PIGS HAVE WINGS.

  Let $n / 0$ be infinity, for any positive integer /n/.

  What English word has the largest /finite/ consonant-vowel-ratio (CVR)? For
  example, the CVRs of the words (including the TLA) in the previous sentence
  are 3:1, 5:2, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 5:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, and infinity (3:0).
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  The largest FINITE consonant-vowel-ratio word that I could find was strengths
  coming in with 8 consonants and just 1 vowel. An example of a non-finite CVR
  could be slyly.

  In the figure below the innermost circle has radius 1. It is circumscribed by
  an equilateral triangle, which is circumscribed by a circle, which is
  circumscribed by a square, which is circumscribed by yet another circle, and
  so forth.

  What is the radius of the outermost circle?

  Pick a number (a positive integer). Form the product of that number, one more
  than that number, and one more than twice that number. Repeat for several
  different numbers. There is a pattern to these products. What is it?

    Pick a positive integer. Mulitply that number by itself, iteself plus one.
    and two times itself plus one. Repeat for several different numbers.
    What is the pattern to these products?
*** Approach
    | I | I + 1 | 2I + 1 |   P |
    |---+-------+--------+-----|
    | 1 |     2 |      3 |   6 |
    | 2 |     3 |      5 |  30 |
    | 3 |     4 |      7 |  84 |
    | 4 |     5 |      9 | 180 |
    | 5 |     6 |     11 | 330 |
    | 6 |     7 |     13 | 546 |
*** Solution
    Each product is divisible by 6.
*** Proof
    6/6 = 1
    30/6 = 5
    84/6 = 14
    180/6 = 30
    Interestingly enough, the difference between the products/6 is the original
    integer squared. 5 -1 = 4 ... 4 = 2 x 2 etc.
